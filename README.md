Cloud computing, as a computing paradigm, has its computing boundaries determined both by economic factors at the top and by technical factors at the bottom. The economic factors determine the business form of this computing paradigm from the top down, and the realization technology determines the technical form of this computing paradigm from the bottom up. The computing paradigm as a cloud computing service can be further understood from two more perspectives:
-Horizontal cloud body logical structure
-Vertical cloud stack logical structure
